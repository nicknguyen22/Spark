#Spark - Song Recommendations by Collaborative Filtering (ALS)

This Spark notebook is dedicated to creating a song recommendation system 
through collaborative filtering. Leveraging the power of the Spark.ml library, it 
employs an implicit matrix factorization model using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) 
to provide personalized song recommendations.
