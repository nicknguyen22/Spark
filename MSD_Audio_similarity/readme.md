# Spark - Audio Similarity: Binary & Multiclass classification

This notebook uses Spark Machine Learning Library, on Spark Distributed 
Computing Platform to predict song genres from audio data. It applies Ridge 
Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree algorithms on large-scale 
data for efficient binary classification and multiclass classification.
